# Assembly: a 2D starship building simulation game

# How to Play
Use the mouse to click and drag the objects around the game world, and to also interact with the interface.

The requirements in the top-left are the modules that need to be present inside the ship design in order for the customer to be satisfied. If these conditions are met, you gain a pretty penny! If not, you lose just the same.

_(TODO: better instructions)_

The buttons on the left-hand side are used to spawn modules and subsystems. Modules are large parts of the ship, and can contain subsystems.

The ship must be assembled in the red assembly area. If the assembled ship lies outside of this area, it won't be counted and you will lose money!

Click the submit button to finalize your design. If you didn't meet the requirements, you'll get another try but you will lose money. If your design was accepted, the screen will clear and you'll have a new list of requirements!

# Background
I made this game in a week for a class I took as part of the Masters of Entertainment Arts and Engineering program at the University of Utah. The class was called "Experimental Gameplay", and it was essentially a series of week-long game jams that encouraged us to experiment with new gameplay mechanics and ideas.

I conceived this concept for one particular jam where we were given the prompt "Explain it in a GIF". I am a huge sci-fi nerd, so I wanted to make something that was interesting to me, but could also be explained with just a few seconds of footage. At the time I was particularly addicted to the game Stellaris, and decided to make a game modeled after its ship designer mechanic.

# Lessons Learned
This project was a lot of fun for me because it was a concept that I was really interested in. Science fiction has a special place in my heart, and I've always wanted to make a game in that genre.

This game isn't without its flaws, and it has a long way to go before it can be called a finished product. Right now the main priority is finding the fun, as I feel like it just isn't there yet. Simply connecting pieces together in jigsaw-like fashion isn't fun on its own, so I need to figure out how I can make it a little more interesting!

**TODO: ADD MORE**

# Planned Features
I am working on expanding this game in my free time. Below is a list of features I'd like to add:
- [x] Add zero-gravity movement of ship modules
- [ ] Add more restrictions for what constitutues a ship (aka not just a single hull piece)
- [ ] Make ship construction more interesting
- [ ] Create more interesting specifications (CO2 atmosphere, no weapons, no escape pods, etc.)
- [ ] Tutorial
- [ ] More interesting and realistic connection mechanisms (modules gravitating towards each other instead of teleporting?
